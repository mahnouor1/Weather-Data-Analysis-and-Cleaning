*Weather-Data-Analysis-and-Cleaning*

This project focuses on data analysis and cleaning techniques essential for preparing datasets for further analysis or machine learning. It includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing data inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key insights using various graphs and plots to understand trends, patterns, and correlations.
Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem, optimizing data quality for model performance.
Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling anomalies within the dataset to ensure the reliability of results.
Data Normalization and Standardization: Scaling data for better performance in machine learning models.
This project highlights the importance of cleaning data to improve model accuracy and ensure robust data-driven decisions.

It covers key data cleaning and analysis tasks, including:

Filling missing values with column means
Dropping irrelevant columns and duplicates
Renaming columns for clarity
Detecting and removing outliers
Visualizing relationships between variables (scatter plots, box plots, histograms)
Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
